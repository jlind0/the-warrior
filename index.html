    My name is <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/general-under-honorable-conditions-failure-to-adapt-to-military-life-lind-yahoo-com-I39oAxB" target="_blank">A1C</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonshareshuman" target="_blank">Jason Lawrence</a> <a href="mailto:lind@yahoo.com">Lind</a>, USAF (Seperated 7 October 2004) and I am a cyberspace operative adjacent to 
    NATO, US DoD and State but really work for an organization I founded: <a href="http://article.uncyber.space" target="_blank">United Nations CYBERSPACE COMMAND</a>. I am the storm.

  <p>Cyberspace was coined by William Gibson in his 1984 classic "Neuromancer" to describe the world that is created when machines augment thought and create another plane of existence. 
    Hyperspace, published as HTTP in 1991, was an early predecessor to this fiction becoming ever closer to reality. Even among upper echelon so called cyber commanders in the US Military protected and defending 
    cyberspace is in an endless cycle of stop-gap bits and bytes mentality when we need to be focusing on advancement.</p>

<p>How can we create new dimensions of reality through augmented technical interaction? That is what we mean by Advancement and it is not necessarily Warfighting. The most successful wars are those never fought.</p>

  <p>Cognitive Warfare, for our purposes, is simply next-order Cyberwarfare, or “beyond the 
bits and bytes”. Social Engineering would be another synonym. Classical Game Theory 
is ultimately about making decisions – given rules and utility curves (and their associated 
payoff functions) who does what? Social Engineering on the other hand could be 
described as an applied branch of Game Theory where the rules and utility curves are 
altered – either in reality or just in meta – to adjust opponents play in reality. Bottom line 
CQW (Cognitive Warfare) is about bending information to the will of the beholder in 
order to manipulate the perceptions of our adversaries. It should be noted this cannot be 
done in a silo – that is employing this tactic will have blowback on the aggressor’s 
population which must be accounted for. </p>
